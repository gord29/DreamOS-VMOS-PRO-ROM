# DreamOS-Vmos
My own custom operating system for Vmos pro!
This rom (the 0.0.1a) is based on [AndnixSH's Android 5.1.1 Custom Rom](https://www.andnixsh.com/2020/09/vmos-pro-custom-roms-android-511-and.html?m=1)
This rom has root, xposed, and Google play services preinstalled (Will remove Gapps in the future).
# Installation
-There are 2 versions of Vmos pro.
  + Global/Google Play Version-Not updated often, big in size(>100mb), but contains all roms and root/xposed files [Download to google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vmos.ggp)
  + China Version-Updated, only some words are in chinese, small in size(26mb), but does not contain roms and root/xposed files (you need to download them). Also, they have their own community forum ([forum](https://bbs.vmos.cn/forum-49-1.html) or inside Vmos cn app). [Download](http://www.vmos.cn/product_center_vmospro.htm)
- Now, to install custom roms, you can go to [HuskyDG's installation tutorial](https://github.com/HuskyDG/VMOSPro_ROM)

P.s this took me 1 week to build lol (mainly because of the custom launcher, custom bootanimation, and some crashes and bootloops [will never modify framework-res.apk again.])
