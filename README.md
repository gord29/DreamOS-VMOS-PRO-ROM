# DreamOS
My own custom operating system for Vmos pro!
This rom (the 0.0.1a) is based on [AndnixSH's Android 5.1.1 Custom Rom](https://www.andnixsh.com/2020/09/vmos-pro-custom-roms-android-511-and.html?m=1)
This rom has root, xposed, and Google play services preinstalled (Will remove Gapps in the future).
This is properly tested but with some ocassional bugs and crashes.
# Installation
~~There are 2 versions of Vmos pro.~~ 

UPDATE: Apparently, newer versions of VMOS have stricter restrictions when applying Custom ROMs. Use modded VMOS to use this ROM. HuskyDG's version is recommended [Link Here.](https://github.com/HuskyDG/VMOSPro_MOD)
### Now, to install custom roms...
*ATTENTION: Make sure to store the files on internal memory, not real SD Card because VMOS can't access SD Card. Your downloaded files are usally stored in /storage/emulated/0/download. Also make sure that your filename DOES NOT contain spaces as it will not install the rom and end with an error.*

1. Open VMOS Pro, grant all permission if this is first time.
2. Click on plus sign on theright hand of the screen
3. Click on the 3 dot button on the corner of your screen
4. There are 3 options, Rec the VM, Import local ROM and download remote ROM. On my ROM, you will need to select "Import local ROM"
5. Go to the location where the ROM files are stored and select it 
6. The ROM will now install and boot up. If it didn't or the Installation Fails, go back to the ATTENTION part then go back here. if it installs then good. if it still didn't, go submit it in issues.
7. ???
8. PROFIT!

 note that if you have a legit VMOS, ya can't turn off Root and Xposed in settings without VIP. 
 
 
 ### note (APRIL 2023)
 google is bs. it now always says "Your Device isn't Play Protect Certified." fix=dont use google play. will try to substitute it with microg+aurora store or smth idk. will do that in next update. for now, ignore that notif and dont open google play. f u google.
